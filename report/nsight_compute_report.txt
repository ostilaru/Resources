          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.1%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 20.2%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          DRAM bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the       
          bytes transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or  
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 20.1%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          each block.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 36.9%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 23.5%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 24.0%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          The difference between calculated theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (76.0%) can be the

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          The difference between calculated theoretical (66.7%) and measured achieved occupancy (46.2%) can be the      
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices   
          Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on     
          optimizing occupancy.

          The 8.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 12. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (66.7%) is limited by the number of warps within  
          each block.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.9%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 23.8%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          The difference between calculated theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (76.2%) can be the     
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          each block.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          The difference between calculated theoretical (66.7%) and measured achieved occupancy (46.4%) can be the      
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices

          The 8.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 295 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 25.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 22.6%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 400    
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model
